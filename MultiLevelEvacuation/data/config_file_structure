## configuration file structure
# this file describes how a configuration file must look like

general
-------
<key> = <value>			Note that the spaces are needed!
floors are numbered from 1 to floor_count, 1 is the ground floor


config file
-----------


agents_per_floor = <agents>					number of agents per floor
agents_radius_min = <min_radius>
agents_radius_max = <max_radius>			radius of each agent in meters
											values are uniformaly distributed between
											min and max

meter_per_pixel = <scale>					scaling to convert meters <--> pixels
											value in meters = pixels * meter_per_pixel

save_frames = <0/1>							whether to save each frame into
											folder frames

frame_basename = <basename of saved frames> name of the saved frames (if save_frames = 1)
                                            frame number is appended at the end

floor_count = <num of floors>
floor_<i>_build = some_image.png			building image for floor i
											i in [1,floor_count]

dt = <timestep>                             simulation timestep in seconds
duration = <duration>                       simulation duration in seconds

tau = <see article 'Simulating dynamical features of escape panic'>
A = <see article 'Simulating dynamical features of escape panic'>
B = <see article 'Simulating dynamical features of escape panic'>
k = <see article 'Simulating dynamical features of escape panic'>
kappa = <see article 'Simulating dynamical features of escape panic'>

r_min = <minimum radius of an agent, see article 'Simulating dynamical features of escape panic' for details>
r_max = <maximum radius of an agent, see article 'Simulating dynamical features of escape panic' for details>
v0 = <desired speed, see article 'Simulating dynamical features of escape panic' for details>
v_max = <maximum velocity of an agent, see article 'Simulating dynamical features of escape panic' for details>
m = <mass of an agent, see article 'Simulating dynamical features of escape panic' for details>

images
------
image format should be png, but can also be something else
image must have 3 channels (RGB) and 8 bits/channel, all images must have the
same dimensions

building image:
 how the building looks like and where the agents are
 - background (ignored)						white   #ffffff
 - walls 									black   #000000
 - agent spawning areas						pink    #ff00ff 
 - exits									green   #00ff00
 - stairs down								blue    #0000ff
 - stairs up								red		#ff0000
 stairs: for each down stairs spot (connected color) there must be an up stairs
 at the same spot on the floor below. this allows multiple stairs per floor.
